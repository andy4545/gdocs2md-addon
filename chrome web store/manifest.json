If you have documents in other formats, like MS Word, you can open them in Google Docs then use this plugin to convert them to Markdown.

Note: This add-on uses the gdocs2md script from https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md If you have any issues or comments about the Markdown output please direct them there. It hasn't been updated in a while but if there's enough interest in this add-on I might fork that project.",
